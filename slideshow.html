<blockquote>
<p>I just remember feeling like everyday was the most embarrassing day
of my life for months on end. Not just that, but while walking to the
university or even just gardening (on campus grounds), I was given the
middle finger, had someone yell about cutting dicks off and then running
away, someone yelled when they saw me “it’s a man!”, and someone also
agressively told me “fuck you” and proceeded to give me the middle
finger at a bus stop. I cried. A lot. For most of those. Except the last
one, where I smiled at the woman and gave her the middle finger in
return, but I’m not sure that was a “good” outcome even.</p>

<p>An optical resonator is an object that when interacting with light,
will continue ring or “sing” with light. You will notice that this
“singing” only occures for distinct patterns or vibrations of light.

<p>A git repo is a “version control system”, meaning that it keeps track

git repo allows you to “go back in time” to previous versions of your
project!</p>
