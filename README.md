Readme for the talk

## Abstract

In this talk, I explore my previous research project in computational quantum chemistry. I plan to review the theory of coupled light-matter systems. I then
will review how I began to implement a computational pipeline.  Finally, Iâ€™ll give some chronology for how the implementation failed during my time coming out as
transgender/genderqueer and how I am currently trying to move forward in research.

Oftentimes, science seems like it needs to be done perfectly, when that is not the case. The goal of this talk will be to convey what it is like to have personal struggles during research. In my case, my struggles were about coming out as queer.I do hope however that you are able to walk away with useful information for any struggles you may face while in science.
