# Notes

- add some more real world examples
- maybe add springs
- big picture: 
- ❌ how to NOT do research or
-  ❌ healthy relationship with stem
- ✅ [here is #mystory](mystory.md)?
	- what experiences did i go through?
	- say what you learned and what you went through

- ✅on rule 3 (slide 7 ) add a picture 
- add a figure of a guitar string
- add a picture of the helmhotlz resonator
- add ![this](https://github.com/Andersen98/ge_2014/blob/main/results/total.gif)
- ask students to come up with resonators
- swing sets
- in a bathtub, slosh the water. Is this a resonant mode?
- crystals in electronics?


Personal story

- talk a bit about how these projects "work" on a long time scale, 
	-> how were my projects like? What did that look like from the reference
	of my life.

- fix ex-girlfriend termonology (confusing)
- add leadin to next slide from day in the life
- more from research experience
- add a "here is what sorta science I do"
    - theory
    - computational
    - papers
- define dysphoria
Question: Do you know any examples of resonators? Discuss with your neighbor

Hint: resonators dont have to be optical

TYPO frustraited Research experience after coming out

    Research was irregular and often not productive. My advisor got pretty frustraited with me. I eventually just had to stop the project and leave the group.

Idea #1 of Optical Resonators

Has resonant modes which get excited due to incoming l
TODO ADD IMAGE 


What controlls the rate of decay for cavities?
Question: Resonant modes have distinct patterns or frequecies, but do they decay at the same rate? Are there any examples of resonators that might "out sing" another? Discuss w/ your neighbor


signal -> frequency
Idea #3 of Optical Resonators

Looking at the resonator signal after "long enough" is a way to look at the resonant mode's signal! helmhotz resonator


WHAT IS GITHUB-> add a slide
Make a github repo!

My Story in Science: Numerically Computing Quasi Normal Modes While Coming Out as Transgender
- add src//CU-Prime-talk-slides-2.pdf
- be there at 4:15pm
- On the day of the talk, you'll join this Zoom link (https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/92769551921) and
