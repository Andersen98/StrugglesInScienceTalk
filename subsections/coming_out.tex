\begin{frame}{My entire social life changed, and that was hard}

When I came out, my social identity changed non-adiabatically. I had to build a new social life as a new person. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done.

\begin{frame}{I accumulated a lot of trauma from wearing dresses and makeup everyday}
At age 24, I felt really really **really* awkward trying to be myself public. I knew that it was okay for me to wear dresses to work, but I felt really unprofessional while doing it. I felt *incompetent* in how I expressed myself.

\begin{frame}{Face dysphoria sucked and still does!}
I have face dysphoria and I was *really* bad when I first transitioned. I got a pretty shocked response when i showed up to the office in this.
