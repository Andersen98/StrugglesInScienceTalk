# My Story

This is the story of my life in grad school. It's almost been five years, would you believe it?

Where do I begin? For one, I entered grad school August 2019. I was born in August of 1996, so I was 23. The plan was for me to live with my fiance and her younger brother, as her younger brother needed a place to stay that wasn't his old home.

I was kind of trying to be an eccentril athletic guy, so I had this bike trailor and I prided myself on being the one to get grocies for myself and two other people with just the power of my legs!

I was was okay with my situation at first to be honest. I was managing grad school somehow. I remember feeling a lot of pride over my "family" at the time. I also remember that my existence was just pure "willpower" though, so I can't say I was really happy. 

## The Pandemic

Thennnn the pandemic hit. Gotta say, I really love this pic of me with the peanut butter (I think it's cuz i just look kinda girl-ish)! Around this time in my life, I was learning about computational chemistry!

I also learned about the #JaynesCummings Hamiltonian in quantum around this time!

This was also what i would call #desk v1

I would kind of really struggle with sitting down at a small desk. I also was using a computer from 2012, so with the pandemic I decided to upgrade.

I was ready to roll with #desk v2 and was working on computational chemistry research! I was (and still am) big on trying to learn regular expressions (gosh okay, they are so powerful!) and I wanted to do it proper, so i bought a book and read a bit of that (also wanted to keep it as a reference).

Still though, my #boymode was beginning to be too much. I kind of hated my physical form. Like, to the point of disgust. I thought that being straight was just living with and dating women so that way I could at least be around their pretty-ness and cool vibes. I didn't really know much about trans folks at this point.

Oh well, I ended up (and still do) associate more with arch linux! I later found out this was pretty femboy of me. I also got a mechanical keyboard and finally got a decent Arch linux install going.

Something that I really enjoyed (and still do) is cooking. I would make yummy food with lots of veggies.

I still would do really trans coded things like saving this image to my google photos: ![](img/anime_windows98.jpg)
Then boulder was on fire, like a lot. ![](img/boulder_fire.png)

Then some time passed…

and I realized I was trans.…


So early transition for me was unlike anything I've ever experienced. For me, I figured out I was trans via educating myself on trans folks to be a better ally. I watched and listened to actual trans folk online and very shortly after I did that is when I made the choice to start hormone replacement therapy. Here are some notes from that time

![](img/early_transition_notes1.jpg)
- I feel happy in a dress, but I also feel terrible
- I long for breasts
- I am finding relaxation in the release from being a "strong" male
    - I want to be treated with care like a sterieotypical female
- Let myself imagine what has felt good so far with current gender
    - things I've tried
    - things I imagine I'd love in the future
 
Let me get one thing straight though. Transitioning felt like a pipe dream. I was depressed because I thought I could never feel like a girl. I never felt like a girl trapped in a man's body. For me I simply thought "huh, it would be really really cool if I was a girl." I didn't know that I was allowed to **be** a girl? Like, I had to just make that choice like when you choose what kinda shoes you get or like  how you decide to send an email. The wild thing is that I used my research experience to make the choice to just "go for it" because I learned that

> wanting to be a girl means you are a girl.

Okay so another pain in my ass was going to the office early transition. I didn't like it one bit. It was a #struggle, I guess. I mainly lived in fear though? It wasn't like I was brave or anything. I just kinda showed up to the office in a bra and I honestly hated running into people that I recognized because it was just kinda really *hard* to exist as a faggot.

All of that awkwardness of puberty mixed just really sucked. Like, I just remember feeling like everyday was the most embarrassing day of my life for months on end. Not just that, but while walking to the university or even just gardening (on campus grounds), I was given the middle finger, had someone yell about cutting dicks off and then running away, someone yelled when they saw me "it's a man!", and someone also agressively told me "fuck you" and proceeded to give me the middle finger at a bus stop. I cried. A lot. For most of those. Except the last one, where I smiled at the woman and gave her the middle finger in return, but I'm not sure that was a "good" outcome even. 

Early in my transition, I told a cis woman that I was afraid of walking home, because it is scary to exist in public while being seen as a man in a dress. She told me in response that she *wished* she could be seen as a man in a dress when walking home, since it would make it safer for her. When she told me this, I was flabbergasted. I have had a lot of cis people tell me things about trans issues, even talk down to me about their trans siblings while procceeding to misgender their trans siblings. These experiences have made it really hard for me to want to even open my mouth about being trans. Now adays I hangout with mainly trans and intersex folk.
