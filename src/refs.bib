	abstract = {In this review we look at the concepts and state-of-the-art concerning the strong coupling of surface plasmon-polariton modes to states associated with quantum emitters such as excitons in J-aggregates, dye molecules and quantum dots. We explore the phenomenon of strong coupling with reference to a number of examples involving electromagnetic fields and matter. We then provide a concise description of the relevant background physics of surface plasmon polaritons. An extensive overview of the historical background and a detailed discussion of more recent relevant experimental advances concerning strong coupling between surface plasmon polaritons and quantum emitters is then presented. Three conceptual frameworks are then discussed and compared in depth: classical, semi-classical and fully quantum mechanical; these theoretical frameworks will have relevance to strong coupling beyond that involving surface plasmon polaritons. We conclude our review with a perspective on the future of this rapidly emerging field, one we are sure will grow to encompass more intriguing physics and will develop in scope to be of relevance to other areas of science.},

	abstract = {We present a Krylov model-order reduction approach to efﬁciently compute the spontaneous decay ({SD}) rate of arbitrarily shaped 3D nanosized resonators. We exploit the symmetry of Maxwell’s equations to efﬁciently construct so-called reduced-order models that approximate the {SD} rate of a quantum emitter embedded in a resonating nanostructure. The models allow for frequency sweeps, meaning that a single model provides {SD} rate approximations over an entire spectral interval of interest. Field approximations and dominant quasinormal modes can be determined at low cost as well.},

	abstract = {In this Review, the theory and applications of optical micro- and nano-resonators are presented from the underlying concept of their natural resonances, the so-called quasi-normal modes ({QNMs}). {QNMs} are the basic constituents governing the response of resonators. Characterized by complex frequencies, {QNMs} are initially loaded by a driving field and then decay exponentially in time due to power leakage or absorption. Here, the use of {QNM}-expansion formalisms to model these basic effects is explored. Such modal expansions that operate at complex frequencies distinguish from the current user habits in electromagnetic modeling, which rely on classical Maxwell's equation solvers operating at real frequencies or in the time domain; they also bring much deeper physical insight into the analysis. An extensive overview of the historical background on {QNMs} in electromagnetism and a detailed discussion of recent relevant theoretical and numerical advances are therefore presented. Additionally, a concise description of the role of {QNMs} on a number of examples involving electromagnetic resonant fields and matter, including the interaction between quantum emitters and resonators (Purcell effect, weak and strong coupling, superradiance, …), Fano interferences, the perturbation of resonance modes, and light transport and localization in disordered media is provided.},
